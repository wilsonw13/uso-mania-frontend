## About

uso!mania is a full-stack web application rhythm game similar to that of the [Guitar Hero series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero), [Piano Tiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Tiles), and of course [osu!mania](https://osu.ppy.sh/home) itself, the game in which we primarily drew our inspiration from. 

The front-end is built on the NuxtJS framework using PixiJS as our graphics engine and is hosted on Netlify.

The back-end is an ExpressJS server connected to a MongoDB Atlas database hosted on Render. We have future plans to swap to Python Flask server connected to a MySQL database with Prisma.

## Local Installation

### Install front-end NuxtJS server:

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [NuxtJS documentation](https://nuxtjs.org).

### Install back-end ExpressJS server:

Create `.env` file with the following variable:

```
DATABASE='<YOUR_DATABASE_URL_HERE>'
```

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8000
$ npm run dev

# serve statically
$ npm run start
```
